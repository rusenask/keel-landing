			<h1><a href="#">No-fuss Deployment updates</a></h1>			
			<p>
				Keel provides a clean, robust solution to update your Kubernetes deployments on image push. </br>
				We encourage the use of <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">semantic versioning</a> but since nobody's perfect - 'latest' tag is supported as well.
			</p>

		<h3>Keel Overview</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Easy to deploy - stateless, runs as a single container.</li>
			<li>Out of the box <a href="https://helm.sh" target="_blank">Helm</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>  integrations.</li>
			<li>No additional CLI/API calls required, works directly through your configuration (labels, annotations, charts).</li>			
			<li>Encourages the use of semantic versioning but can work with <code>latest</code> tags as well.</li>
			<li>Easy to extend with your custom triggers or deployment providers.</li>
			<li>Built for Kubernetes but support can be added for Swarm, Mesos, Nomad and other providers.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Why?</h3>
		<p>
		   Keel was built for lightweight, micro-service architecture based environments, where having a heavy CI/CD engine with lots of
		   dependencies
		   that consumes more resources than your whole backend (that's actually doing the important work for your business) doesn't make sense.		   				   
		   </br>
		   You should consider using Keel if:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You don't want your "Continous Delivery" tool to consume more resources than your actual deployment does.</li>
			<li>You are not Netflix, Google, Amazon, {insert big company here} that already has something like Spinnaker that has too many dependencies such as "JDK8, Redis, Cassandra, Packer".</li>
			<li>You want simple, automated Kubernetes deployment updates on code/image push.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Features</h3>		
		<ul>
			<li>Automated subscription management for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/"  target="_blank">Google Container Registry</a>.</li>
